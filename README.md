I am Junhan (Chase), a practicing full stack web developer from Singapore.

My passion in the field comes greatest in developing software solutions to businesses that could be improved in one way or another utilizing it. 

I enjoy crafting solutions to real problems that I or others have faced, an example of which would be the tedious process of insurance being expedited with use of my OISS Project.

I like to keep up to date with new technologies and different fields of learning, and am currently studying more on machine learning using Tensorflow to develop effective predictive models that can have applications to tackle difficult problems.
